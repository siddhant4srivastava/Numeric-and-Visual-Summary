Exploring Data with Numeric and Visual Summaries of a Bank Loan Dataset

Data visualization is a powerful tool that helps us understand complex datasets in an intuitive way. In our latest exploration, we dive deep into a bank loan dataset, showcasing how to effectively visualize and interpret data.

Types of Visualizations:

1. Single Numeric Variables: Discover the distribution of variables using density plots and identify outliers with box plots.

2. Numeric vs. Numeric Variables: Uncover relationships between pairs of numeric variables through scatter plots and pairwise density plots.

3. Faceting Data: Learn how to visualize data chunks based on categorical variables for deeper insights.

4. Categorical Variables: Get a clear view of categorical data with frequency bar plots.

5. Faceting of Categorical Variables: Dive into segmented views of your categorical data.

6. Heatmaps: Visualize correlations and patterns in matrix form using heatmaps.
